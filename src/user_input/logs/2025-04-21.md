# Development Notes - April 21, 2025

## Overview
Today's work focused on developing a more proper testing infrastructure for the user input component of the Firefly project based on:

- [User input PR/review](https://github.com/Leenkh3/Firefly/pull/29#pullrequestreview-2763441551)

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Directory Structure Improvements
- Merged ./test directory with ./src/test directory for better organization
- Updated CMake configuration to point to the new test location
- Adjusted relative paths in test files

### 2. Dependency Resolution
- Modified CMake configuration to use system Lua when available instead of always building it

### 3. Documentation
- Created developer logs for the user input feature/branch.

### 4. Test Fixes
- Fixed issue with test script path after directory restructuring
- Added automatic copying of test Lua script to the build directory
- Updated environment variable to use the build directory path

## Known Issues
- Build errors occur when dependencies are missing (m4, zlib, gfortran)
- NetCDF dependency requires additional configuration on some systems

## Next Steps
- resolve conflicts with branch main
